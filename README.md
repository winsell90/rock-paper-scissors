This project helped me to learn transitions and the use of click events. I initially had a game that played in the console without any user interface. That first game ran through a loop of 5 questions that came in a dialog box. 

I created the user interface and had to make the playRound function call whenever a picture was clicked, which indicated a selection of rock, paper or scissors.
